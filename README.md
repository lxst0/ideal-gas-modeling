# ideal-gas-modeling
Ideal gas can be described in therms of absolutely solid balls, that collide with each other and walls absolutely elastically. It is known from statistical mechanics that a macroscopic system (with a particle count of the order of $10^{23}$) comes to a Maxwell distribution of velocyties. However, it turns out that the same distribution is established quite quickly for small systems, for example, with 500 particles, which I confirm with the help of this simulation.
